        <h1>WORKOUT PLANS</h1>
        <p>If you're just starting out, the gym can be overwhelming. From choosing exercises to figuring out a schedule, you want to build muscle as quickly as possible all while not failing like so many other beginners do.</p>
        <p>This 20 week quick start program takes you from point A to point Z, providing you with specific workouts and training schedules that will help you make those gains and reach the level of success you are after. This workout program features 3 specific stages:Stage 1 - Neuromuscular Adaptation </p>
        <p>The focus during this 4 week stage is on learning the exercises, practicing proper form, and developing the habit of actually getting to the gym and not missing workouts. You will be working out only twice a week but using the same workout each day.</p>
        <p>Another 4 week stage. You will train 3 days per week and learn how to push yourself properly on each exercise. Sets will be maximized, and you will start to add strength and muscle.</p>
        <p>Stage 3 - Maximizing Beginner Gains This is a 12 week stage that will have your working out 4 days per week. The format will be an upper/lower style of training. You will get as strong as possible using conventional muscle building rep ranges.</p>
        <p>Once you finish this 20-week program, you're probably wondering what to do next to keep making progress in the gym. A solid diet paired with consistency in the gym will keep you on track to reach your goals. </p>
