        <h1>More INFO</h1>
        <p>You need protein to build and maintain muscle. To achieve this, you should be looking to eat at least 1g per 454g of body-weight. That’s 200g/day if you weigh 91kg. The easiest way to get this amount is to eat a whole protein source with each meal. These include:
          • Red meat. Beef, pork, lamb, etc.
          • Poultry. Chicken, turkey, duck, etc.
          • Fish. Tuna, salmon, sardines, mackerel, etc.
          • Eggs. Don’t believe the cholesterol myths. Eat the yolk.
          • Dairy. Milk, cheese, cottage cheese, quark, yogurt, etc.
          • Whey. Not necessary but great for easy post workout shakes.
          • Try vegan options too, such as lentils, tofu, seeds and nuts. </p>
        
        <h2>10 BODYBUILDING TIPS FOR BEGINNERS</h2>
        <p>TBefore you do anything in bodybuilding, it’s vital that you master proper form. Otherwise, you’ll pick up bad habits that are hard to break. There’s a lot of help available online, so ensure you do your research and perfect it. </p>
        <p><strong>When you start off bodybuilding it can be tempting to work at it every day, but this isn’t always best. Make sure you give your body a day off between workouts to recover, repair and relax. </strong></p>
        <p><i>As with any kind of workout, it’s important to stretch before bodybuilding. Stretching decreases the chances of damage and soreness. Plus, it increases the amount of motion possible and you’ll be able to put more into your different lifts. </i></p>

          Eating the right thing at the right time is crucial for helping you boost your muscle mass. The easiest way is to eat your breakfast, lunch and dinner as usual, interspersed with meals post workout, pre-bed and with two snacks in between. By keeping your food intake up, it will mean you won’t be as hungry, because eating smaller meals more often versus a few big meals will decrease your stomach size. You’ll feel full more quickly and your waist will trim, while you’ll also have fewer cravings. Not eating for long periods can cause you to over-eat at the next meal or topping yourself up with unhealthy snacks from the vending machine. So to stop any cravings, eat at fixed times every day and your body will get hungry at those fixed times.

          A lot of beginners focus all of their energy on bodybuilding lifts and forget about cardio. For best results, save cardio until after you have completed your workout and focus the majority of your energy on lifting.
